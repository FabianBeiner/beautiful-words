This is an effort to create better default templates for Microsoft Word.
The main focus here is legibility: **I want your text to be easily readable by anyone**.
This is done by increasing the page margins and line height to give your text a bit more
room to breathe. The fact that it looks damn professional is a nice bonus ;)

## How to use
[Download these files](https://github.com/iamarcel/beautiful-words/archive/master.zip) and open up one
of the templates. That's it!
